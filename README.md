# Project Title: Using Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus for deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton Model of Investing

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my bachelor's thesis project, titled "Using Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus for deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton Model of Investing." This project encompasses an extensive exploration of the Black-Scholes-Merton model, involving simulations, formula validation and visualization using Python.

## Repository Contents

- **black_scholes_merton.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains code related to my experimentation and implementation of various aspects of the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Although not all the code within this file was directly utilized in my bachelor's thesis, it served as an experimental playground for testing different techniques.

- **brownian_motion.ipynb**: In this Jupyter Notebook, you will find code dedicated to exploring Brownian motion and its applications within the context of the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Again, not all of it is being used in the thesis.

- **visualizations.ipynb**: The code in this Jupyter Notebook focuses on generating visualizations that support the narrative of my thesis. It showcases the plots and graphical representations used to validate the theory and enhance the overall understanding of the topic.

- **functions.py**: This Python module contains a collection of helper functions specifically developed for this project. These functions serve to streamline the implementation process and ensure code reusability and maintainability.

- **bsc_thesis.pdf**: The bachelor's thesis document can be found in this file. It provides a comprehensive explanation of the project, contextualizing the code outputs within the broader narrative and theoretical framework of the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
